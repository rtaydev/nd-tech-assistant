# ND Tech Assistant

Tech interviews are stressful for many developers, but for neurodivergent individuals, the artificial and high-pressure environment of a tech test can be overwhelming. Neurodivergence, which includes ADHD, autism, and dyslexia, often comes with difficulties in handling stress, processing information quickly, and maintaining focus. In an interview setting, these challenges can cause candidates to freeze or hyper-focus on the interviewer, ultimately impacting their performance in ways that do not reflect their technical abilities.

Interviews, especially tech tests, are often designed in a way that simulates “real” coding environments but are far from genuine. The combination of time limits, being observed, and solving unfamiliar problems can trigger intense anxiety for neurodivergent individuals, making it harder to showcase their true skills.
